in 0.6:
+ new window design
+ new class structure
+ manage backup drives menu activate/ button

+ backup item's destination path drive letter update
+ restructure backup settings + menu

+ allow destination to be a non existing folder
- delete backups when item is deleted or modified
- help tooltips
+ async backuping process
- indication for ongoing backup process (show progress in 'manage selected item menu', color backupitem blue, display notification)
- cancel operation button for ongoing backup process
+ fix: view destination button visibility when it does not exists yet
+ fix: size limit check always resets after restart
+ fix: upon first opening the add new task menu, the modify button is seen

- fix: the enable backup button is still visible when the source is missing
- fix: trying to access DriveInformation when it is null
