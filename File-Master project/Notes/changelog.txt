Release of Demo version v0.9 -> Deadline: 2023.04.15

in 0.9:
- support for partitioned drives (drive id)
- create log file to store events ('//LOG' indicates undefined log in code)
- make the 'settings' class static, and put it in a separate file
- create a static UserInterface class
- use backup size limit implementation
- display total amount of backup space on drive in backupdrives menu
- events / current operations menu (shows the tasks in order, the time they will deploy and other informations)
- run on windows startup
- prevent opening application while it is already running
- menu redesign
- import stored backups into the program (search for backups in folder)
- custom data recovery location (not the source folder)
- only grab the window from the top section(toolbar)
- add option to store backup task information globally too (to have the data when the destination is unreachable)
- test for bugs before release

in the future:
- low performance demand mode (don't do backup when cpu is load is high)
- sleep mode while minimized (stops processes temporarily)
- select compression format
