- support for partitioned drives (drive id)
- create log file to store events ('//LOG' indicates undefined log in code)
- make the 'settings' class static, and put it in a separate file
- create a static UserInterface class
- use backup size limit implementation
- display total amount of backup space on drive in backupdrives menu
- events / current operations menu (shows the tasks in order, the time they will deploy and other informations)
- run on windows startup
- prevent opening application while it is already running

- sleep mode while minimized (stops processes temporarily)
- select compression format
